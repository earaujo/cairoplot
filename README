  The CairoPlot Porting to C code - Version 0.0.1
   (https://github.com/earaujo/cairoplot)
  Copyright 2011 Ã‰werton Assis (earaujoassis at gmail dot com)


        CairoPlot is a library based upon PyCairo, written in Python, and used to plot graphics
(see [0] and [1] for more information). This porting was born in December 2010; but there's already 
a supposed to be official porting project also based upon CairoPlot [2], althought it is based upon
Cairo and Gnome/Gtk+.
        This porting can be used in any cairo_context_t, then, on any target surface.
        The porting was not finished (it is far from that), so it has some use limitations. So far
it supports:
            * Dotted-line graphics

        Please refer to the included LICENCE file for terms of use. This porting is licensed under
LGPL v2.1 just as the original code written in Python.
